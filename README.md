Tree View Dart Polymer Widget
================

## Features ##
* Single- and multi-selection
* View-model for hierarchical tree items
* Icon styling (e.g. with custom font icons)
* Events for selection, expand and collapse
* Animation for expand and collapse

## Example ##
The example is inside the **`web`** because Pub Build does not work with the 
`example` directory.

## Credits ##
* The [Tree](http://html-components.appspot.com/components/data/tree) component 
by Gabor Szabo has been a helpful source of inspiration.
* A few [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons have 
been included with the help of the great [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) icon 
font generator.
