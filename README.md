# TreeView element for Polymer.dart #

## Features ##
* Single- and multi-selection
* View-model for hierarchical tree items
* Icon styling (e.g. with custom font icons)
* Events for selection, expand and collapse
* Animation for expand and collapse

## Example ##
The example is inside the [`web`](https://github.com/marcojakob/dart-makery-ui-tree-view/tree/master/web) 
because Pub Build does not (yet) work with the `example` directory.

## Credits ##
* The [Tree](http://html-components.appspot.com/components/data/tree) component 
by Gabor Szabo has been a helpful source of inspiration.
* A few [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons have 
been included with the help of the great [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) icon 
font generator.
